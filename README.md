# ROS-Navigation-Comparison
A report comparing classic navigation stack and the navigation with reinforcement machine learning
## 1. Introduction
Navigation is one of the most fundamental challenges in mobile robotics.  
In the Robot Operating System (ROS), two major approaches are commonly discussed:  
the classic navigation stack, which relies on deterministic algorithms such as SLAM, localization, and path planning,  
and reinforcement learning (RL)-based navigation, which leverages machine learning to allow robots to learn from experience.  

This report aims to provide a comparative study between these two approaches,  
highlighting their strengths, limitations, computational requirements, and potential applications in real-world environments.  
The goal is to identify in which contexts each approach is most suitable,  
and how future research may bridge the gap between classical methods and learning-based methods.
