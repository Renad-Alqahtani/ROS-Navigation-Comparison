# ROS-Navigation-Comparison
A report comparing classic navigation stack and the navigation with reinforcement machine learning
## 1. Introduction
Navigation is one of the most fundamental challenges in mobile robotics.  
In the Robot Operating System (ROS), two major approaches are commonly discussed:  
the classic navigation stack, which relies on deterministic algorithms such as SLAM, localization, and path planning,  
and reinforcement learning (RL)-based navigation, which leverages machine learning to allow robots to learn from experience.  

This report aims to provide a comparative study between these two approaches,  
highlighting their strengths, limitations, computational requirements, and potential applications in real-world environments.  
The goal is to identify in which contexts each approach is most suitable,  
and how future research may bridge the gap between classical methods and learning-based methods.

## 2. Classic Navigation Stack

The classic navigation stack in ROS is a modular framework designed to enable mobile robots to move from one point to another while avoiding obstacles.  
It integrates several well-established components that together form a deterministic and reliable navigation pipeline:

1. Mapping (SLAM – Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)  
   - Builds a map of the environment while simultaneously estimating the robot’s position within it.  
   - Popular algorithms: Gmapping, Hector SLAM, Cartographer.  
   - Strength: Provides accurate maps in structured indoor environments.  

2. Localization  
   - Estimates the robot’s pose (position and orientation) relative to the map.  
   - Uses probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL).  
   - Ensures the robot always knows “where it is” on the map.  

3. Path Planning  
   - Divided into:  
     - Global Planning: Calculates an optimal path from start to goal using algorithms like Dijkstra or A*.  
     - Local Planning: Adjusts the path in real time to avoid dynamic obstacles, using methods like DWA (Dynamic Window Approach).  
   - This hierarchical planning ensures both efficiency and safety.  

4. Control and Execution  
   - Sends velocity commands to the robot’s motors based on the planned path.  
   - Incorporates feedback loops to reduce error and maintain stability.  

### Strengths
- Proven reliability in structured environments.  
- Wide adoption and strong community support in ROS.  
- Computationally efficient compared to learning-based approaches.  

### Limitations
- Limited adaptability to highly dynamic or unknown environments.  
- Performance depends heavily on the accuracy of the map and sensors.  
- Requires significant manual tuning of parameters (cost maps, planners, controllers).

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-Based Navigation

Reinforcement Learning (RL) introduces a fundamentally different approach to robot navigation compared to the classic stack.  
Instead of relying on pre-programmed algorithms, the robot learns navigation strategies through trial and error by interacting with the environment.  
The learning process is driven by rewards (for successful actions, such as reaching the goal) and penalties (for undesired actions, such as collisions).

### Core Concepts
1. Agent and Environment  
   - The robot acts as the *agent* that perceives its surroundings and takes actions.  
   - The *environment* provides feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  

2. State, Action, Reward  
   - State: The robot’s current perception (e.g., laser scan, camera input, position).  
   - Action: Possible movements (e.g., forward, rotate, stop).  
   - Reward: Numerical feedback that guides learning (positive for reaching target, negative for collisions).  

3. Policy and Value Function  
   - The *policy* defines how the robot chooses actions based on its state.  
   - The *value function* estimates the expected cumulative reward of states and guides the agent towards long-term goals.  

4. Training Methods  
   - Common RL algorithms:  
     - Q-Learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN) → Value-based.  
     - Policy Gradient & Actor-Critic (PPO, A3C) → Policy-based.  
   - Training is usually done in simulation (e.g., Gazebo) to avoid real-world risks.  

### Strengths
- Adaptability: Can handle dynamic and unstructured environments.  
- Generalization: Learns strategies that can sometimes transfer to different environments.  
- Autonomy: Requires less hand-tuning of navigation parameters once trained.  

### Limitations
- High Computational Cost: Requires powerful GPUs and long training times.  
- Unstable Results: Performance depends heavily on training quality and reward design.  
- Safety Concerns: May behave unpredictably in real-world deployment.  
- Data Dependency: Needs large amounts of simulated experience to perform well.

| Aspect              | Classic Navigation | Reinforcement Learning |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Stability           | High              | Medium (depends on training) |
| Adaptability        | Low               | High |
| Computational Cost  | Low               | High |
| Ease of Use         | Easy (ready in ROS) | Complex (needs training) |

## 5. Conclusion
- Classic navigation is practical and reliable for most real-world applications.
- Reinforcement learning navigation is more experimental and useful for research in dynamic environments.
